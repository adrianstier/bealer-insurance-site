  {
    question: "What's the average cost of car insurance in Goleta?",
    answer: "The average annual car insurance premium in Goleta ranges from $1,400 to $2,200, depending on your driving history, vehicle, and coverage levels. This is slightly lower than Los Angeles due to lower traffic density and crime rates. We can often find savings by comparing multiple carriers."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need full coverage or just liability?",
    answer: "California only requires liability insurance, but if you have a car loan or lease, full coverage (liability + collision + comprehensive) is typically required. Even without a loan, comprehensive coverage protects against common Goleta risks like car break-ins near UCSB and deer strikes on Highway 154."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I lower my auto insurance rate?",
    answer: "Common ways to save include: bundling with home/renters insurance (up to 25% off), maintaining a clean driving record, completing defensive driving courses, good student discounts for drivers under 25, low mileage discounts if you work from home, and choosing a higher deductible."
  },
  {
    question: "What discounts are available for UCSB students?",
    answer: "UCSB students can qualify for good student discounts (typically 10-25% off with a B average), distant student discounts if the car stays home, and multi-policy discounts when bundling with renters insurance. Some carriers also offer discounts for completing driver's ed."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do after a car accident in Goleta?",
    answer: "First, ensure everyone's safety and call 911 if needed. Exchange information with other drivers, take photos, and file a police report if there's significant damage. Then contact us - we'll help file your claim and guide you through the process with the insurance company."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my insurance cover me in Mexico?",
    answer: "Most U.S. policies don't cover you in Mexico. If you're planning a trip to Baja, you'll need separate Mexican auto insurance. We can help you get short-term Mexico coverage before your trip."
