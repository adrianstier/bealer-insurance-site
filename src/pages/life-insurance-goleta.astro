const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much life insurance do I need?",
    answer: "A common rule of thumb is 10-12 times your annual income, but the right amount depends on your specific situation: mortgage balance, number of dependents, existing savings, and future expenses like college. A local agent can help you calculate the right coverage amount for your family."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between term and whole life insurance?",
    answer: "Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period (like 20 years) and is generally more affordable. Whole life insurance covers you for life and builds cash value over time, but costs more. Many Goleta families start with term insurance and add permanent coverage later."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does life insurance cost in California?",
    answer: "Costs vary widely based on age, health, coverage amount, and policy type. A healthy 30-year-old might pay $20-30/month for a $500,000 term policy. Rates increase with age, so the best time to buy is when you're young and healthy."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a medical exam for life insurance?",
    answer: "Traditional policies require a medical exam for the best rates. However, many carriers now offer no-exam policies with simplified underwriting. These are convenient but may cost more or offer lower coverage limits."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get life insurance if I have health issues?",
    answer: "Yes! While some conditions may affect rates or coverage options, many people with health issues can still get life insurance. A local agent can shop multiple carriers to find the best options for your specific situation."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I buy life insurance?",
    answer: "The best time is now - you're never younger or healthier than today. Key life events like marriage, buying a home in Goleta, having children, or starting a business are all good triggers to get or increase coverage."
