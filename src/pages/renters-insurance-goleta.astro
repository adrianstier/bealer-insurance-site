  {
    question: "How much does renters insurance cost in Goleta?",
    answer: "Renters insurance in Goleta typically costs $15-30 per month for $30,000 in personal property coverage and $100,000 in liability. UCSB students and Isla Vista residents often qualify for even lower rates with multi-policy discounts."
  },
  {
    question: "Does my landlord's insurance cover my belongings?",
    answer: "No. Your landlord's insurance only covers the building structure, not your personal belongings or liability. If there's a fire, theft, or water damage, your possessions wouldn't be covered without renters insurance."
  },
  {
    question: "What's covered under renters insurance?",
    answer: "Renters insurance covers your personal belongings against theft, fire, vandalism, smoke damage, and certain water damage. It also provides liability coverage if someone is injured in your rental and additional living expenses if you're displaced."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need renters insurance for UCSB student housing?",
    answer: "While not always required, we strongly recommend it. UCSB dorms and Isla Vista apartments are frequent targets for theft. A policy can cover laptops, bikes, phones, and other valuables - often for less than the cost of a streaming subscription."
  },
  {
    question: "Does renters insurance cover my roommates?",
    answer: "Typically, no. Each roommate needs their own policy unless you're married or domestic partners. However, many insurers offer discounts for referrals, so you and your roommates can all save by getting coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "Is bike theft covered by renters insurance?",
    answer: "Yes! Bike theft is covered under personal property coverage. Given how common bike theft is in Isla Vista and around UCSB, this alone can make renters insurance worthwhile. Just make sure your coverage limit is high enough."
