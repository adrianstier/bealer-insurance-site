const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How much home insurance do I need in Goleta?",
    answer: "Your dwelling coverage should be enough to rebuild your home completely (not the market value). In Goleta, average rebuild costs range from $300-500 per square foot depending on materials and finishes. We recommend getting a replacement cost estimate to ensure adequate coverage."
  },
  {
    question: "Is wildfire coverage included in home insurance?",
    answer: "Basic fire coverage is typically included, but Goleta homeowners may need additional wildfire-specific coverage. Some insurers are limiting coverage in high-risk areas like the foothills. We work with multiple carriers to find coverage for homes in all risk zones."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need earthquake insurance?",
    answer: "Standard home insurance doesn't cover earthquake damage. Given Santa Barbara County's seismic activity, we strongly recommend adding earthquake coverage. California Earthquake Authority (CEA) policies are available through us."
  },
  {
    question: "What discounts are available for Goleta homeowners?",
    answer: "Common discounts include: bundling with auto insurance (up to 25%), security systems, fire-resistant roofing, updated electrical/plumbing, being claims-free, and newer homes. Many Goleta homes with Spanish tile roofs qualify for fire-resistant discounts."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I file a home insurance claim?",
    answer: "Contact us first - we'll help you document the damage and guide you through the process. Take photos, make temporary repairs to prevent further damage (keep receipts), and don't dispose of damaged items until the adjuster has seen them."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between actual cash value and replacement cost?",
    answer: "Actual cash value pays the depreciated value of items. Replacement cost pays what it costs to replace items with new equivalents. We recommend replacement cost coverage for both dwelling and personal property to avoid out-of-pocket expenses after a loss."
